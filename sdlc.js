// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const AnalaysisofRequirements = 'This is the second step, in which developers should gather information to develop the project, usually from a marketing or business analyst. Then they can produce a software requirement dspecification for the client.'

const Design = 'This is the third step, in which they will use the srs to create the software arhictechture '

const Implementation = 'This is the fourth step, is when they take the software architecture to turn it into source code and then implement it into the program'

const TestingandIntegration ='This is the fifth step, in which the modules are released and tested for bugs to be corrected.'

const Maintain = 'This is the final step, in which developers maintain the product with updates and quality of life checks.'
